# THIS IS A GUIDE - Copy the changes from COMPARISON_SETUP_GUIDE.txt and apply them manually or we can create a Python script to do it

The main changes needed are:
1. Add comparison functions to JavaScript
2. Add checkboxes to phone cards 
3. Add comparison modal HTML
4. Add CSS styles for comparison feature

These are too extensive for automated patching. Please run the setup script or follow the guide.
